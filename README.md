# 👨‍🍳Cookr_v1

### A cooking app designed to help students easily discover and cook new recipes.

- This app was made as part of a final project for a **software development course**. It was developed by myself and one other classmate.
- One of our databases was on ***MySQL workbench***.
- A custom API, designed by the professors of the course, was used to connect our app to the MySQL database.
- As an additional feature, we wanted certain parts of our app to function offline. To make this possible, I used the ***Android Room persistance library***.
- The front-end of the app was made using ***Android Studio***
